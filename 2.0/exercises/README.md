# exercises

1. Read about CVE-2001-0500, a buffer overflow in Microsoftâ€™s Internet
Information Services. (This vulnerability is commonly referred to as the Code
Red worm vulnerability.)
2. Add a `read_from` and a `write_to function` to Listing 3-6. These functions
should read or write to `upper` or `lower` as appropriate. Perform bounds check-
ing to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Add an `Element*` previous to Listing 3-9 to make a *doubly linked list*. Add
an `insert_before` method to `Element`. Traverse the list from front to back, then
from back to front, using two separate for loops. Print the `operating_number`
inside each loop.
4. Reimplement Listing 3-11 using no explicit types. (Hint: use `auto`.)
5. Scan the listings in Chapter 2. Which methods could be marked `const`?
Where could you use `auto`?

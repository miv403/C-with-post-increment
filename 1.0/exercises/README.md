# calculator

**2-1.** Create an `enum class Operation` that has values `Add`, `Subtract`,
`Multiply`, and `Divide`.

**2-2.** Create a `struct Calculator`. It should have a single
constructor that takes an `Operation`.

**2-3.** Create a method on `Calculator` called `int calculate(int a, int b)`.
Upon invocation, this method should perform addition, subtraction,
multiplication, or division based on its constructor argument and
return the result.

**2-4.** Experiment with different means of initializing `Calculator` instances.
